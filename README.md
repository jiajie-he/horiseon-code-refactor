# horiseon-code-refactor

## On-the-job ticket

### About

* I'm motivated by preparing for the workflow I'll experience as a professional web developer
* Gained experience refactoring existing code to exceed my client's acceptance criteria
  * Ensured all the links functioned properly
  * Consolidated and organized the code
  * Added comments to identify each section
* Made Horiseon's site more accessible
  * Increased accessibility by approximately 30% - generated by Lighthouse

### Acceptance criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
