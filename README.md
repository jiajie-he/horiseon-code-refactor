# horiseon-code-refactor

## About

* I'm motivated by preparing for the workflow I'll experience as a professional web developer
* Gained experience refactoring existing code to exceed my client's acceptance criteria
  * Ensured all the links functioned properly
  * Consolidated and organized the code
  * Added comments to identify each section
* Made Horiseon's site more accessible
  * Increased accessibility by approximately 30% - generated by Lighthouse

### Acceptance criteria
